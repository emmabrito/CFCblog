    Next Prototype
     <br>

    For the second iteration of my prototype I wanted to expand on the first one, rather than completely coming up with a new one.  I edited together some of the interviews in order to see if I could formulate a narrative or message from them. Through the editing I highlighted the commonalities between the answer that I received, as well as moments of insight into the duality of their experiences. The associations of locations with words/concepts were also edited together in order to create an easy comparison for the results. I created simple graphs of the immigrant presence, and generational status, of both Canadians and Torontonians. The information for the graphs is taken from Statistics Canada databases and serve as stand-ins for what will eventually be data visualizations. Ideally they would also be animated to provide more of a narrative.
      <br>
    Why?
      <br>
    I chose to head in this direction as a prototype for a number of different reasons. As I already mentioned I wanted to try to create a narrative or at the very least, compile the answers received in a cohesive way which provides insight into their unique experiences. The audio begins with an insightful comment from one of the subjects about existing in two realities. This is then followed by the subjects stating where they are from and have lived. The results of the game, through the voices of the subjects, are then played. The idea is that the graphs and statistics of the population could be examined while the audio is being listened to. This is another major reason my I chose to pursue this kind of prototype: I wanted to experiment with data contextualizing, and informing, these interviews of very personal experiences and opinions.
      <br>
      In-session discussion: Feng
  <br>    Feng was the first to try the prototype, and it is also worth noting that she is one of the voices which can be heard within it. I explained how the prototype works but she seemed more interested in listening to the audio track rather than looking at the data. She mentioned that she was not sure what I was looking to do with the interview when it was originally recorded; that she didn’t understand what I was hoping to find out. After listening to the audio track she told me she had a clearer understanding of what I am hoping to examine with this line of questioning. She was also curious to find out the results I found with everyone else in the interview. She didn’t look at the visuals at all because they didn’t grab her attention in the way that the audio did.    <br>

  <h3><center>Blog Post 4: Next Iteraction</h3>
    <center><img src="http://gdurl.com/xO9L" width="320" height="240"></iframe></center>
    <br>
    In class we broke off into groups and used Post-its to go through what we did with our first iteration and what we then hope to create moving forward in the course. I received helpful feedback from
    my peers who asked about how I plan to present the information that I have, as well as how I would incorporate the data. Due to these prompts I decided to put these videos and recordings on a digital platform
    as a sample of what I hope to create for my final project. The prototype will be altered to better suit the demographics represented in the initial prototype. The picture above shows the "Next Steps" section of this group activity.
    <br>

    I found that this method of prototyping helped me gain a better understanding of the kinds of questions which will be most effective moving forward with the interviews I plan to conduct with my case studies. I led with open-ended questions and this was usually effective because the subject was left to ponder their question as much as they wanted. There were a few issues I ran into with this method however; if the subject was not fully comfortable or unsure of the question their answers were brief and often not fully related to the original question. This took some secondary questioning in order to find the truth, something which will be more difficult to do once I move past prototyping because of issues with the REB. I will have to be more careful with my language to ensure that it is specific, clear, and also accessible.
   Something else that I will also have to take into account is the effect that the camera has on a subject’s behavior. I noticed a distinct difference in the behavior of my subjects when they were being filmed as opposed to when I was just recording their voice. Those whose audio was only being recorded seemed much more at ease and the interview became far more conversational. It was Emilia and Yiyi who had a video being recorded and their body language changed almost instantly as the recording began. They both gave me detailed answers, but the presence of the camera is something that I’m going to have to acknowledge moving forward, and how it may or may not affect the answers I receive and behavior of the subject being interviewed. After all, the researcher’s presence and role in their ethnographical findings has been an issue, let alone how the knowledge of being recorded will influence results.
   Finally, I took the advice of trying to incorporate user-driven research into this prototype in order to let the subjects depict some autonomy over how they identify. This is where the Post-it activity came into play.

    <br>
    The next activity questioned the values that we hope our project possesses, as well as how to achieve them. The main interaction with my project is "examine" while the values include community, connection, and self-reflection. I initially had a hard time identifying the values which my project deals with simply because it is something that had never crossed my mind. The idea that each project should touch on values is interesting because it helps explain the “so what?” and “why” questions we are asked to answer at every stage. I initially started with values like “curiosity” but realized that I had to dig deeper than that because it really only applied to my own interests. I identified “community” as a value because this is at the heart of my project; the preservation of it, how it functions, and the values that tie members together. “Connection” was included because I am interested in exploring what ties communities together (ie. Language, geography, heritage, etc...) as well as how communicative digital tools like social media can be used to maintain these bonds, even if altered in the process. Finally, “self-reflection” because the interviews and case studies I plan on conducting rely on this exact process from the subject. Their reflections of their own identity is how the whole project will be informed.
    <br>
  The way in
    which these values will be achieved is through listening and witnessing the interviews and case studies. Exploration will also be a large part of the experience. Both through exploration of identity and exploration of the platform itself which will host the project.

<h3><center>Blog Post 1: 3 Similar Projects</h3>

  <h4><center>"Very Frustrating Mexican Removal" -
   An immersive 360° verbatim documentary</h4>
<center>  <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/cfc.production/assets/assets/000/007/423/_450x315/image_fusun_uzun.png?1493064491"></center>
<br> <center>Artwork by Fusun Uzun</center>
<br>
<br>
This was a DF thesis project in 2017. Uzun described the thesis as examining "the Canadian immigration detention system through an immersive, interactive artwork, which questions how the state’s discourse about immigration contradicts ongoing practice." is to explore the blurred lines between forensis, method and theoretical framework."
Once again, this was an experiment in increasing sensitivity of the viewer to an experience they have most likely not had. A new form of documentary was used in order to tell the story. While I am looking at using a documentary website, this one was 360 degrees in order to immerse the viewer. This documentary focused on some of the trials
immigrants go through when trying to pursue a different life.
<br><h4>The Questions</h4>
What? - An 360 degree immersive documentary on detention centres for immigrants.
<br> Why? - It is important shed light on the struggles of people who are potentially being mistreated. It is something which is easy to ignore or overlook, so the medium in which the story is told makes it impossible to look away.
<br> How? - It is told through an immersive documentary.
<br>So What? - The importance of this project is very topical. It is relevant to Canada in particular as it is a country of immigration. While it would have been important to shed light on at any point in our history, it is especially necessary now after light has been shed on what is going on in the USA. Canadians also should be aware of
what is happening in their country.


<h4><center>"In My Mother Tongue"</h4>
<center><img src="http://kofflerarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMMT_900x500.jpg"></center>
<br><center>Artwork by Koffler Digital</center>
<br>
<br>
This was Koffler initiative where youths performed their own poetry in both English and their mother tongue. Not only was it an outlet to tell their personal stories, but also an expression of the duality of identity when it exists in two locations. I chose to include this project because it deals with the complex construction of identity while
the manner in which it is expressed is completely in the control of the individual. True, a format is given to the poets/performers, but beyond that it is their decision to express themselves in any manner that they choose.
<br><h4>The Questions</h4>
What? - It is a project which allows youths to examine the construction of their identities.
<br> Why? - This project serves as an emotional outlet and self expression of internal conflicts.
<br> How? - It does this through the use of poetry; they write their own poems and then read them aloud.
<br>So What? - This is yet another project that is relevant for the space in which it took place; particularly in Toronto which is one of the most diverse cities in the world. It is reflective of the city in which the project occured.
<h4><center>"Welcome to Pine Point"</h4>
<center><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8d/ca/24/8dca24f9e621a71d04de4de1d6c85e55.jpg"></center>

<br>
<br>
While the subject matter that this project deals with is very different from my areas of interest, this interactive documentary is relevant because of the platform in which it tells the story. <i>Welcome to Pine Point</i> explores memories of the eponymous mining town in the Northwest Territories. It uses old photos, letters, and other paper based
trinkets so that it feels like a scrapbook of the town. The narrative is effectively weaved through these artifacts so that any viewer feels an intimate and deeply personal attachment to the location. I'm interested in this affect and how the creators were able to make the viewers invested despite it being so far removed from their own location and
experience.
<br><h4>The Questions</h4>
What? It is an interactive documentary which was hosted on a website. The documentary examines the memories of an old mining town.
<br> Why? - It examines memory of a location and what is potentially lost.
<br> How? - It does this by creating a scrap-book like documentary. It includes old photographs and artifacts.
<br>So What? - This project matters because the documentary tells the story of a mining town which is still very present in the memories of its former inhabitants. It also references a way of life which can be expanded to other similar cases, as well as their demise. A famous example of course would be Flint Michigan where the economy was closely tied to <thead>
  auto industry and ultimately suffered when the industry died. This town was no different with the mining industry. This is simply one story which reflects a number of other cases.
