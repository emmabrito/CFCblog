  <h4>"Very Frustrating Mexican Removal" -
   An immersive 360° verbatim documentary</h4>

This was a DF thesis project in 2017. Uzun described the thesis as examining "the Canadian immigration detention system through an immersive, interactive artwork, which questions how the state’s discourse about immigration contradicts ongoing practice." is to explore the blurred lines between forensis, method and theoretical framework."
Once again, this was an experiment in increasing sensitivity of the viewer to an experience they have most likely not had. A new form of documentary was used in order to tell the story. While I am looking at using a documentary website, this one was 360 degrees in order to immerse the viewer. This documentary focused on some of the trials
immigrants go through when trying to pursue a different life.

This was Koffler initiative where youths performed their own poetry in both English and their mother tongue. Not only was it an outlet to tell their personal stories, but also an expression of the duality of identity when it exists in two locations. I chose to include this project because it deals with the complex construction of identity while
the manner in which it is expressed is completely in the control of the individual. True, a format is given to the poets/performers, but beyond that it is their decision to express themselves in any manner that they choose.

<h4>"Welcome to Pine Point"</h4>

While the subject matter that this project deals with is very different from my areas of interest, this interactive documentary is relevant because of the platform in which it tells the story. <i>Welcome to Pine Point</i> explores memories of the eponymous mining town in the Northwest Territories. It uses old photos, letters, and other paper based
trinkets so that it feels like a scrapbook of the town. The narrative is effectively weaved through these artifacts so that any viewer feels an intimate and deeply personal attachment to the location. I'm interested in this affect and how the creators were able to make the viewers invested despite it being so far removed from their own location and
experience.
